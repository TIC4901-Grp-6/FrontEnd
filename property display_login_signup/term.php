	<span></span>1.<span> </span>INTRODUCTION<br />
<br />
1.1&nbsp;Welcome to the property platform (the "Site"). Please read the following Terms of Service carefully before using this Site or opening an account ("Account") so that you are aware of your legal rights and obligations (individually and collectively, "Shopee", "we", "us" or "our"). For the purposes of these Terms of Services, “Affiliates” means, with respect to an entity, any entity that Controls, is Controlled by, or is under common Control with, that entity, where "Control" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management, operating policies, or assets of that entity, whether by way of ownership of more than 50% of its voting or equity securities or assets, or by way of contract, management agreement, voting trust, or otherwise; provided that the term "Affiliates" shall include any variable interest entity regardless of whether any variable interest entity may be, or required to be, consolidated with that entity under generally accepted accounting principles. <br />
<br />
1.2<span> </span>The Services include an online platform service that provides a place and opportunity for the sale of goods between the agent (“Agent”) and the buyer (“buyer”) (collectively “you”, “Users” or “Parties”). The actual contract for sale is directly between Buyer and Seller and Shopee is not a party to that or any other contract between Buyer and Seller and accepts no obligations in connection with any such contract. Parties to such transaction will be entirely responsible for the sales contract between them, the listing of goods, warranty of purchase and the like. <br />
<br />
1.3<span> </span>Before becoming a User of the Site, you must read and accept all of the terms and conditions in, and linked to, these Terms of Service and you must consent to the processing of your personal data as described in the Privacy Policy linked hereto.&nbsp;<br />

Property may release certain Services or their features in a beta version, which may not work correctly or in the same way the final version may work, and we shall not be held liable in such instances.<br />

IF YOU ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 18 OR THE LEGAL AGE FOR GIVING CONSENT HEREUNDER PURSUANT TO THE APPLICABLE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY (THE “LEGAL AGE”), YOU MUST GET PERMISSION FROM A PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN TO OPEN AN ACCOUNT AND THAT PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN MUST AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE REACHED THE LEGAL AGE, OR DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS SECTION, PLEASE DO NOT CREATE AN ACCOUNT UNTIL YOU HAVE ASKED YOUR PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN FOR HELP. IF YOU ARE THE PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN OF A MINOR WHO IS CREATING AN ACCOUNT, YOU MUST ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT ON THE MINOR'S BEHALF AND YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL USE OF THE ACCOUNT OR COMPANY SERVICES USING SUCH ACCOUNT, WHETHER SUCH ACCOUNT IS CURRENTLY OPEN OR CREATED LATER.
